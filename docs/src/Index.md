## Overview

There are a few main steps to authentication using Frequency Access.

1. Your application sends the user the Frequency Access redirect URL
2. Frequency Access verifies the user, and the user signs the requested payload(s)
3. Frequency Access sends the signed user payloads back to your application
4. If needed, your application sends the signed payloads to Frequency
5. Your application logs in the user, and the user's session begins
